To run the game, open up a Terminal/Command Prompt window and 'cd' to the directory where the downloaded folder is.
Next, to check if your system has python installed, type 'python -v'.  You should be running Python 2.7; if anyone gives you shit for not updating to Python 3, tell them you'll learn it when all the Python code on your computer is Python 3.

Then, run 'python -u test.py' to run the test program, which should output a line of text if the system is compatible with the program.

If the test program runs successfully, run 'python -u rift.pyo' to launch the game.
