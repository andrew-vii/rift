This is a simple little text-based adventure game that I made for a friend to help teach some basics about computer security. If you're more versed in that stuff, some parts of this game may seem basic for you.


There are two versions of the game: obfuscated and unobfuscated. I've included the unobfuscated code because I realize that asking people to download an obfuscated python file from someone who posts about hacking is probably a bad idea. So, if you want proof that I'm not doing anything funny, look through the unobfuscated code, just make sure to comment out the correct line for the screen to clear itself based on what OS you're running. If you'd rather play without having an easy way to grab the answers, download the obfuscated version that corresponds to your OS.


To run the game, open up a Terminal/Command Prompt window and 'cd' to the directory where the downloaded folder is.
